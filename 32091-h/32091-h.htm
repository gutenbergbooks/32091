<span class="i0">As if with echoing, and the stars<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While red with war the gusty Mars<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rained upon earth his ruddy beams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shone alone, low down the West,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While I, behind a hawthorn-bush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watched on the fairies flaxen-tressed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The fires of the morning flush.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, as a mist, their beauty died,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their singing shrill and fainter grew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And daylight tremulous and wide<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Flooded the moorland through and through;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Urdon's copper weathercock<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was reared in golden flame afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dim from moonlit dreams awoke<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The towers and groves of Arroar.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Unctuous odours that wreathed and swirled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where'er frisked a whisker or mouse-tail twirled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While out of the chimney up into the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ne'er-to-be-snuffed-too-much smoke took flight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That's one," says the Fairy, finger on thumb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"So now, Mister Sam, there's but two to come!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She leaned her head sidelong; she lifted her chin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a twinkling of eye from the radiance within.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Sam stood astounded; he says, says he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I <i>wish</i> my old Mother was back with me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if there was one thing she couldn't refuse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas a sweet thick slice from the breast of a goose."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his cheek grew stiff and his eyes stared bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there, on her stick, pushing out of the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tap-tapping along, herself and no other,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came who but the shape of his dear old Mother!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight into the kitchen she hastened and went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her breath coming quick as if all but spent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why, Sam," says she, "the bird be turning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my nose tells I that the skin's a-burning!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down at the oven the ghost of her sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And basted the goose with the boiling fat.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oho," cries the Fairy, sweet and small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Another wish gone will leave nothing at all."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sam sighs, "Bless 'ee, Ma'am, keep the other,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's nowt that I want now I have my Mother."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the Fairy laughs softly, and says, says she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"There's one wish left, Sam, I promised 'ee three.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hasten your wits, the hour creeps on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's calling afield and I'm soon to be gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon as haps midnight the cocks will crow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And me to the gathering and feasting must go."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sam gazed at his Mother&mdash;withered and wan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rose in her cheek, her bright hair, gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her poor old back bent double with years&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he scarce could speak for the salt, salt tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Well, well," he says, "I'm unspeakable glad:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But&mdash;it bain't quite the same as when I was a lad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's joy and there's joy, Ma'am, but to tell 'ee the truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's none can compare with the joy of one's youth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if it was possible, how could I choose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But be back in boy's breeches to eat the goose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the old things&mdash;and my Mother the most,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shine again real as my own gatepost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What wouldn't I give, too, to see again wag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dumpity tail of my old dog, Shag!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your kindness, Ma'am, but all wishing was vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless us can both be young again."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shrill, faint laughter from nowhere came ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Empty the dark in the candle-flame....<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And there stood our Sam, about four foot high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snub nose, shock hair, and round blue eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breeches and braces and coat of him too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shirt on his back, and each clodhopping shoe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had shrunk to a nicety&mdash;button and hem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fit the small Sammie tucked up into them.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was his Mother, too; smooth, dear cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lips as smooth as a blackbird's beak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pretty arched eyebrows, the daintiest nose&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the smoke of the baking deliciously rose.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come, Sammie," she cries, "your old Mammikin's joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Climb up on your stool, supper's ready, my boy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring in the candle, and shut out the night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's goose, baked taties and cabbage to bite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, bless the wee lamb, he's all shiver and shake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you'd think from the look of him scarcely awake!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If 'ee glour wi' those eyes, Sam, so dark and round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The elves will away with 'ee, I'll be bound!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Sam and his Mother by wishes three<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And there&mdash;with a bumpity tail to wag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat laughing, with tongue out, their old dog, Shag.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To clatter of patter, bones, giblets and juice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between them they ate up the whole of the goose.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But time is a river for ever in flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weeks went by as the weeks must go.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon fifty-two to a year did grow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The long years passed, one after another,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making older and older our Sam and his Mother;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, alas and alack, with nine of them gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Shag lay asleep again under a stone.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Into Sam's dreams, as he lay asleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That his Mother was lost, and away he'd fare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calling her, calling her, everywhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In dark, in rain, by roads unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under echoing hills, and alone, alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What bliss in the morning to wake and see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun shining green in the linden tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And out of that dream's dark shadowiness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To slip in on his Mother and give her a kiss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And go whistling off in the dew to hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thrushes all mocking him, sweet and clear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still, moon after moon from heaven above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone on Mother and son, and made light of love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her roses faded, her pretty brown hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had sorrowful grey in it everywhere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at last she died, and was laid to rest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her tired hands crossed on her shrunken breast.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Pinks, Sweet William, and sops-in-wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blackberry, lavender, eglantine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when these had blossomed and gone their way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas apples, and daisies and Michaelmas Day&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Like the thought that what happens has happened before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fed the chickens, he fed the sow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a three-legged stool sate down to the cow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a pail 'twixt his legs in the green in the meadow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the elm trees' lengthening shadow;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In a bucket of well-water soused his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sate gloomily gooming at loaf and cheese&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gooming and gooming as if the mere sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his victuals could satisfy appetite!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the longer and longer he looked at them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slimmer slimmed upward his candle flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blue in the air. And when squeaked a mouse<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then, sudden, a soft little wind puffed by,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then&mdash;soft as a rattle a-counting her seeds<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And a breath at the keyhole as soft as milk&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still as the flit of a moth. And then ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That infinitesimal knocking again.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sam lifted his chin from his fists. He listened.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then slowly, slowly, rolled round by degrees&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there sat a mouse on the top of his cheese.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stared at this Midget, and it at him,<br /></span>

Over the edge of his mug's round rim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And&mdash;as if it were Christian&mdash;he says, "Did 'ee hear<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There sate three crows upon a bough, and three times three is nine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then "O!" said Lucy, in the snow, "it's very plain to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A witch has been a-walking in the fields in front of me."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then stept she light and heedfully across the frozen snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plucked a bunch of elder-twigs that near a pool did grow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, by and by, she comes to seven shadows in one place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretched black by seven poplar-trees against the sun's bright face.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She looks to left, she looks to right, and in the midst she sees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little pool of water clear and frozen 'neath the trees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then down beside its margent in the crusty snow she kneels,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hears a magic belfry a-ringing with sweet bells.<br /></span>

Clear sang the faint far merry peal, then silence on the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And icy-still the frozen pool and poplars standing there:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then lo! as Lucy turned her head and looked along the snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sees a witch&mdash;a witch she sees, come frisking to and fro.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her scarlet, buckled shoes they clicked, her heels a-twinkling high;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With mistletoe her steeple-hat bobbed as she capered by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never a dint, or mark, or print, in the whiteness for to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though danced she high, though danced she fast, though danced she lissomely.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It seemed 'twas diamonds in the air, or little flakes of frost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed 'twas golden smoke around, or sunbeams lightly tossed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed an elfin music like to reeds and warblers rose:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nay!" Lucy said, "it is the wind that through the branches flows."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And as she peeps, and as she peeps, 'tis no more one, but three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eye of bat, and downy wing of owl within the tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bells of that sweet belfry a-pealing as before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now it is not three she sees, and now it is not four<br /></span>

"O! who are ye," sweet Lucy cries, "that in a dreadful ring,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"A witch, and witches, one and nine," they straight to her reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looked upon her narrowly, with green and needle eye.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Lucy sees in clouds of gold green cherry trees up-grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bushes of red roses that bloomed above the snow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She smells, all faint, the almond-boughs blowing so wild and fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And doves with milky eyes ascend fluttering in the air.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Clear flowers she sees, like tulip buds, go floating by like birds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wavering tips that warbled sweetly strange enchanted words;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as with ropes of amethyst, the boughs with lamps were hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clusters of green emeralds like fruit upon them clung.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O witches nine, ye dreadful nine, O witches seven and three!<br /></span>

But straight, as in a clap, when she of Christmas says the word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here is the snow, and there the sun, but never bloom nor bird;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nor warbling flame, nor gleaming-rope of amethyst there shows,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Stooped in the still and shadowy air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lips unseen&mdash;and kissed me there.<br /></span>
